Face Detection using Python and OpenCV with webcam | Python Projects | GeeksforGeeks,4 months ago,78,2.3K views,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=129exLkKeks,"In this Project, we will see how to develop real-time human face detection in Python using OpenCV. The objective of the program given is to detect objects of interest(faces) in real-time and to keep track of the same object. Face Recognition is a part of computer vision where we locate and visualize faces using ML models in any digital image. 
OpenCV contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc. Face detection using Haar cascades files is a machine-learning approach where the model is trained with a set of input data. 

You need to download the trained classifier haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml from here: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree... 
which is available in OpenCv’s GitHub repository.
